# Hey, Iâ€™m Jasim ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been building software since I was 17.  
Started out curious, stayed that way ever since.

I didnâ€™t plan to get into automationâ€”it kind of found me. While working on various projects, I kept noticing how much time teams were losing to repetitive work. So I started helping quietlyâ€”building small tools to smooth things out. That slowly grew into something bigger.

Now, on the side, Iâ€™m building systems that help early-stage teams spot workflow bottlenecks and generate tiny tools to fix them. Nothing complexâ€”just the kind of tools that make you wonder why you didnâ€™t have them earlier.

### My way of working

I donâ€™t rush to code.  
I like listening first, understanding how things actually run, then building just enough to remove the friction.  
Most of my work sits quietly in the background, doing its thing without needing attention.

Along the way, Iâ€™ve led full-stack projects from scratch to productionâ€”some of which supported real growth for teams that didnâ€™t have time to slow down.

### These days

- Building automation tools that reduce manual work  
- Partnering with founders to clean up operations  
- Exploring ideas that may or may not turn into something bigger  

Iâ€™m more interested in whatâ€™s essential than whatâ€™s impressive.  
And I donâ€™t mind the uncertaintyâ€”most of the fun is there anyway.

If youâ€™re here out of curiosity, welcome.  
If youâ€™re building something and it feels a bit messy, Iâ€™d be happy to talk.
