I'm a dreamer who thinks about what changes I can make in the future days. the thousands of thoughts run through my mind I always try out new things. That's also why I'm here also I became a passionate flutter developer.

As a dreaming developer, I'm currently able to build anything I know there are limitations to my knowledge but that's easy to learn if it becomes a thing to grab.so I'm ready for that curve
